Website Starter Pack
====================

This is a starter pack for using [Notenik](https://notenik.app) to create a website. 

If you are unsure how to use this, then you might wish to start with the *HTML for People demo* starter pack (# 16). 

This project folder contains the following files and subfolders. 

+ project-INFO.nnk - A configuration file used by Notenik
+ content - The demo content folders, which are meant to be accessed as Notenik collections 
+ factory - The scripts and templates that can be used to build a website from the content 
+ README.md - This file (the one you are now reading) 
+ resources - Another Notenik collection, this one containing links to various helpful resources on the web
+ web - The folder that will contain your demo website, as it is built by Notenik
